		<h2>1. Install the motherboard</h2>
		<hr />
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/motherlift.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/mothergraylift.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Place the motherboard into the lower case as shown above, and place the metal tray over the metal board.
		</p>
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/mothergrayscrews.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/mothergrayarrow.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Screw the screws previously taken from the metal tray into the spots marked above, also marked on your board with arrows.
		</p>
		
		<h2>2. Install the disc drive</h2>
		<hr />
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/motherlift1.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/motherloosen.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Insert the black tray over the metal tray, and slide it inward so that the black squares line up with the metal squares.
		</p>
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/discremove.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/discscrews.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Add the disc drive back, and screw in the screws marked above.
		</p>
		
		<h2>3. Install the power board</h2>
		<hr />
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/powerdisconnect.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/powerunscrew.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Place the power board as shown, and connect the pin connector to it. Screw in the marked screws.
		</p>
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/powerribbon.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/powerpreview.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Connect the ribbon cable to the power board.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			⚠️ We advise against fiddling with the power board ribbon cable
			as much as possible as it is rather fragile and trust me, you really
			don't want that to break.
		</p>
		
		<h2>4. Install the fan</h2>
		<hr />
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/fanpull.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/fanscrew.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Rotate the console 180<sup>o</sup> laterally so that the power board is on the far right corner. Insert
			the pin connector back into the fan, and screw the fan screws in the marked locations.
		</p>
		
		<h2>5. Put the case back together</h2>
		<hr />
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/minipull.jpg" width="100%">
		<p>
			Push the upper case into the lower case.
		</p>
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/miniscrews.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/minifeet.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Turning the console upside down, screw the final 4 screws into the locations marked above, then add the 2 missing feet.
		</p>
		
		<h2>After reassembling the console</h2>
		<hr />
		
		<p>
			Please note that you may have to set your date and time again from Wii Settings >
			Calendar or your console may time travel to 20XX (the year of the
			Nintendo Switch successor release) and you may never see it again.

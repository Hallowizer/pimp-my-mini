		<h1>Pimp my mini</h1>
		<hr />
		<p>Welcome to Pimp my mini! This website is a group of written
			guides to help you get the most out of your not-so-good purchase of a
			Wii mini by adding hardware modifications that will make it totes
			cool and ultra nice n' stuff. There are some ground
			rules that need to be set for your own safety and to ensure that you
			don't absolutely butcher the heck out of your poor little console:</p>
		<div class="center"><img src="images/deathmini.jpg" width="480"></div>
		<p>So, in order to avoid a dead Wii mini, you have to be able to
			follow the following rules:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Authorised burnstick wielders only: <br /> Please, for the
				love of all that is holy, do NOT attempt any of this if you don't
				know what the hell you're doing. These mods should only be performed
				by a qualified 1337 Haxx0r who can at the absolute minimum hold a
				soldering iron without causing a üî• üî• üî•.
			</li>


			<li>Read twice (or even better, thrice), do once: <br /> You
				should read the instructions of each mod enough times that you can <span
				class="strike">perform it with one hand tied behind the back
					while underwater and drunk with Victory Gin</span> clearly understand what
				they say <span class="bold underline">before</span> performing the
				mod or even ordering the parts required for it.
			</li>


			<li>Mistakes are ¬©Ô∏è Yourself 2021, All Rights Reserved:<br />Neither
				I, nor anyone else in this server or anywhere on God's green earth
				is responsible for the atrocities you commit on your poor, helpless
				little console. Always think twice before doing what some rando
				moron on the interwebz tells you to do, especially since it may kill
				your console, yourself or anyone using your beloved red-and-black
				magic box of vidya gamez.
			</li>
			<li>Got any questions? I don't care. <br />Someone else in the
				community however, might. So please, if you have any questions or
				doubts feel free to click the Create Thread button in the step
				you're stuck in or send a message in pimping-assistance and ask your
				question. Someone is guaranteed to answer until the end of this
				miserable timeline. What's that? No there isn't? Oh, really? Well
				I'd be delighted to see you prove that. ‚ÄãIn any case, fellow
				hackster, I hope from the bottom of my null, unix-based heart that
				you enjoy making the most poggers Wii mini the world has ever seen.
				If you made something really damn cool, make sure to post it in
				wii-mini-hacking to assert your dominance over all the other
				software-hacking plebs that are guaranteed to be looking at your
				masterpiece with their chin clipping through the floor into a
				vertically parallel dimension.
			</li>

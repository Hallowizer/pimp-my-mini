		<h1>Disassembling the Console</h1>
		<hr />
		
		<p>This part of the guide to Wii mini heaven is common to all mods
			that you can do and must be obligatorily followed before you begin.
			Make sure you have read info first and that you have the following
			tools:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A Phillips #0 screwdriver</li>
			<li>A pair of tweezers</li>
			<li>Plastic opener</li>
		</ul>
		
		<!-- https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nintendo+Wii+mini+Motherboard+Replacement/37774#s86618 provided the guide I based this on -->
		<h2>1. Open the case</h2>
		<hr />
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/minifeet.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/miniscrews.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Turn the Wii mini upside down such that the word "Wii" on the bottom is rightside up. Remove the feet as labeled in the diagram,
			and remove the 4 screws, 2 of which were concealed by feet.
		</p>
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/miniloosen.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/minipull.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Turn the console rightside up again, and use a plastic opening tool to separate the upper case from the lower case. Once it has
			been sufficiently separated, use your hand to remove the upper case. This should not require much force; when in doubt, more plastic
			tool.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Your console should now look like this:
		</p>

		<h2>2. Remove the fan</h2>
		<hr />
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/fanscrew.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/fantweezer.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Rotate the Wii mini 180<sup>o</sup> laterally so that the fan is facing you. Remove the screws shown above, using tweezers if
			the screwdriver does not fully pull them out.
		</p>
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/fanpull.jpg" width="100%">
		<p>
			Gently pull the pin connector shown above to fully remove the fan.
		</p>
		
		<h2>3. Remove the power board</h2>
		<hr />
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/powerpreview.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/powerribbon.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Turning the Wii mini back to its original orientation, slide the blue ribbon found on the left.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			⚠️ We advise against fiddling with the power board ribbon cable
			as much as possible as it is rather fragile and trust me, you really
			don't want that to break.
		</p>
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/powerunscrew.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/powerdisconnect.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Unscrew the two screws marked in the diagram above, then gently pull the pin connector on the left. The power
			board is now ready to be removed.
		</p>
		
		<h2>4. Remove the disc drive</h2>
		<hr />
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/discscrews.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/discremove.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Unscrew the screws marked above, and then simply take the disc drive out.
		</p>
		
		<h2>5. Isolate the motherboard</h2>
		<hr />
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/motherloosen.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/mothersquares.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Gently pull the black tray toward you to loosen it. Before fully removing it, ensure that the black square pieces are separated
			from the metal square pieces.
		</p>
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/motherlift1.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/motherblackgone.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Lift the black tray to remove it. Your Wii mini should now look like the image on the right.
		</p>
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/mothergrayscrews.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/mothergrayarrow.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Unscrew the marked screws, which also have arrows printed on the board next to them (see right image).
		</p>
		
		<img src="images/ifixit/mothergraylift.jpg" width="49.7%"> <img src="images/ifixit/motherlift.jpg" width="49.7%">
		<p>
			Remove the metal tray, and the motherboard can be found underneath.
		</p>
		
		<h2>After taking apart the console</h2>
		<hr />

		<p>Make sure you are properly storing the rest of the parts and
			screws of the console somewhere organised and safe.</p>

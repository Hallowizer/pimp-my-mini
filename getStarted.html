		<hr />
		
		<p>This part of the guide to Wii mini heaven is common to all mods
			that you can do and must be obligatorily followed before you begin.
			Make sure you have read info first and that you have the following
			tools:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A Phillips #0 screwdriver</li>
			<li>Soldering iron with your favourite tips for SMD soldering
				and required tools for it (such as solder, flux, wick etc.)</li>
			<li>a pair of tweezers</li>
			<li>A multimeter with at least continuity test mode so you make
				sure stuff's happening</li>
			<li>your beverage of choice in a preferably sealed container to
				prevent from pouring it onto the console.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Once you have all of the above, follow <a
				href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nintendo+Wii+mini+Motherboard+Replacement/37774">this
				guide from iFixit</a> to get your motherboard out of your case.
		</p>

		<p>ℹ️ To reassemble your console, follow the above guide in the
			opposite direction, using common sense as a guide. Please note that
			you may have to set your date and time again from Wii Settings >
			Calendar or your console may time travel to 20XX (the year of the
			Nintendo Switch successor release) and you may never see it again.</p>
		<p>Make sure you are properly storing the rest of the parts and
			screws of the console somewhere organised and safe.</p>
		<p>⚠️ We advise against fiddling with the power board ribbon cable
			as much as possible as it is rather fragile and trust me, you really
			don't want that to break.</p>
		<p>Once the board is out of the case, you are now ready to perform
			the hardware mod(s) of your choice from the following list:</p>
		<p class="nextStep">
			<a href="resetButton.html">Reset Button</a> - Add the missing reset
			button to your console, allowing you to enter Priiloader without a
			keyboard and most importantly, ragequit after falling for the 15th
			consecutive time off the edge in Rainbow Road.

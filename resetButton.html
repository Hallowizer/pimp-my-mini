		<h1>Reset Button</h1>
		<hr />
		
		<p>This is the least exciting, but arguably a rather useful mod,
			especially along with the SD card mod. Don't expect anyone to
			congratulate you for it, even @άκηςμαύρο can do it. I can assure you
			you'll need it anyway so here we go.</p>

		<p>
			⚠️ Make sure you have read <a href="index.html">Info</a> and followed
			<a href="disassembleConsole.html">Disassembling the Console</a> before proceeding.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="bold underline">Difficulty:</span> 1/5
		</p>
		<p class="bold underline">Parts required:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Two pieces of wire, any length will do, better be small (we
				recommend about 2/3rds the size of @Odyssey346's pp or 32awg) so it
				doesn't take up space and it's easier to bend into shape.</li>
			<li>One Normally Open push button. Please, don't be like
				DeadlyFoez, use a button that doesn't short itself by default
				putting your console to an indefinite loop of re- re- re- resetting.</li>
			<li>Two tablespoons of hope</li>
			<li>A pinch of patience</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>1. Grab your wii mini board and flip it over to the back side</h2>
		<hr />
		
		<p>
			Done? Wow you must be a bloody genius.
		</p>

		<h2>2. Connect the button to the test point</h2>
		<hr />

		<img src="images/tp233.png">
		<p>
			Take your glorified
			burnstick and use that funny melty metal thing of yours to solder one end of one wire to that point. Then, take the
			other side of that same wire and solder it to one pin of the button.
			It shouldn't matter which one if it has two.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If you're a pleb
			and using surface mount buttons with 4 pins or something else, grab
			your multimeter in continuity mode and check which of these pins are
			shorted together and which are only shorted when you press the
			button. Solder it to any of the pins, but make sure your other wire
			goes to a pin that only shorts with the first when the button is as
			depressed as a 13 year-old white TikTok girl.
		</p>
		
		<h2>3. Connect the button to a ground point</h2>
		<hr />
		
		<img src="images/groundpads.png">
		<p>
			Solder one end of the other wire to
			any ground point on the board. Some recommended ones are marked below
			in grey. If you know how to find a ground point yourself, you can
			solder it there. Note that we do not recommend using <code>TP172</code>
			in section C as it may be used later for a different mod. Also keep
			in mind that some of the ground pads in the perimeter are covered by
			the metal shielding of the console so make sure you don't overdo it
			with solder or the shield may not close properly.
		</p>
		
		<h2>After adding the reset button</h2>
		<hr />
		
		<p>
			If you aren't planning to
			continue wasting time on another mod, find a place to mount your
			reset switch, a popular location is above the USB port or inside the
			dvd cover. Then, close up your console and boot it up. Try pressing
			the reset button while in the Wii menu. If the menu reloads,
			congratulations! You have now added <span class="italic">a
				button</span>! If you have <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Priiloader">Priiloader</a>
			installed (which you <span class="italic">should</span> if you want any chance of your console
			surviving some bricks) you can now enter it by holding Reset when the
			console boots.
